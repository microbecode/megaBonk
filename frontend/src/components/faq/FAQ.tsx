            question="Why upgrade Bonk Token to megaBONK?"
            answer="By shedding the 1% transfer tax, the MegaBONK token will become more liquid, allowing for more lively exchange.

            question="How did the original BONK Token start?"
            answer="The liquidity was locked on Uniswap & there was no presale/ICO of the tokens. The project was launched with 89% of the tokens sent to a decentralized exchange where anyone can purchase if they wish to use BONK's utility. The other 11% was used for development & art related work. This locking was a response to all the other projects that were rugging during the time. You should always research before investing in anything."

            question="Why is megaBONK using NFTs?"
            answer="All in all, we want to experiment with the value and ownership of an image. A NFT is only as valuable as it's context, and that's why megaBONK uses IPFS so the user & the community have more control of their metadata."
