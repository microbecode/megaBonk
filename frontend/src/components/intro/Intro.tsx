                  Bonk is a decentralized erc20 token that was created on the
                  Ethereum network & is a utility token that can be used to
                  create NFTs. There is a 1% fee on all transfers & a 9%
                  withdraw fee that is sent to the users who are staking so
                  there is no guaranteed return, but those who are staking
                  benefit by the more transactions on the network.

                  BONKâ€™s vision for NFTs are to utilize them in a multifaceted
                  way & you can create your own NFTs using BONK. This will come
                  from professional artists being able to create commissioned
                  pieces and the community being able to create their own
                  designs & mint them into an NFT.
